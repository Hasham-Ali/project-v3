                    <li>If request for refund is made before the delivery of initial design(s), then you would be

                        concern.</li>

                    <li>For website packages no refund request will be entertained once website development has been
                        completed or once the website has been deployed live.</li>
                    <li>For video animation packages no refund request will be entertained after the designing of the
                        storyboard.</li>
                    <li>All refund requests should be communicated to the support department. innovativeghostwriters,
                        based on the violation of your user agreement reserves the right to approve/disapprove your
                        request on an individual case to case basis.</li>
                    <li>For innovativeghostwriters, custom packages refund will be applicable as it is on the single
                        packages.</li>
                    <li>For example, if you order logo and web design service and approve the logo, you can claim refund
                        for the website service at the time of initial design only.</li>
                    <li>A refund request will need to have a valid reason which must be qualified against the design
                        brief and customer feedback for revisions. Unless a concept has not been designed according to
                        the brief, a refund will not be given however further revisions will be provided until complete
                        satisfaction.</li>
                    <li>Money back guarantee is based on the term that the order is placed in good faith. Where a
                        customer has placed design orders with more than one design agency for the same job with the
                        intention to claim refund, we do not consider it as a good faith. In such a case we reserve the
                        right to decline a refund request.</li>
                    <li>All design jobs require customer feedback before finalizing the design therefore it is only fair
                        that the customer gets involved and provides feedback in order to get the desired results.</li>
                    <li>100% unique design guarantee entitles you to re-draw if our designed logo is to be found
                        considerably similar to another logo design that may already exist. Any resemblance to an
                        existing design will be merely a coincidence and innovativeghostwriters will not accept any
                        responsibility or claim of any compensation in such a case. It is the client's responsibility to
                        get their art work copyrighted.</li>
                </ul>
